            <h3>What is Bitcoin Diamond?</h3>
            <p>Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is a fork of Bitcoin that occurs at the predetermined height of block 495866 and
                therewith a new chain will be generated as the BCD. Bitcoin Diamond miners will begin creating blocks
                with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and will consecutively develop and enhance the protection for
                account transfer and privacy based on original features of BTC. This will cause a bifurcation of the
                Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue unaltered, but a new branch of the
                blockchain will split off from the original chain. It shares the same transaction history with Bitcoin
                until it starts branching and coming into a unique block from which it diverges. As a result of this
                process, a new cryptocurrency was created which we call “Bitcoin Diamond”.
            </p>

        <div class="box">
            <h3>What is the total amount for Bitcoin Diamond (BCD)?</h3>
            <p>The total amount of BCD is 210 million. No more increase. 170 million BCD, 1BTC : 10BCD will be presented
                to the Bitcoin holders for the long-term Bitcoin ECOSYSTEM support. The rest 40 million will be
                automatically transferred into the community rewards pool as tributes and mining.

        <div class="box">
            <h3>What problems do Bitcoin Diamond attempt to solve?</h3>
            <p>After nine years of rapid development of Bitcoin, high transactions fees and Bitcoin no longer meets the
                demands from rising numbers of clients.

            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 30px;">Various kinds of problems have arisen, which mainly consist of the following
                aspects:
            </h4>
            <p>1. Lack of privacy protection.
                2. Slow transaction confirmations.
                3. High threshold for new members.</p>
            <h4>Is Bitcoin Diamond a competitor of Bitcoin?</h4>
            <p>No, Bitcoin Diamond is fork of the Bitcoin blockchain with upgraded technology while preserving the
                original features of Bitcoin. A series of new encryption techniques are introduced to encrypt the amount
                in the transfer, further ensuring the privacy of customers. Besides, it raise the storage size and the
                block-out speed of each block to an optimum value, in order to speed up the entire transaction process
                of the Bitcoin Diamond and minimize the production of isolated blocks.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h3>How can I get Bitcoin Diamond?</h3>
            <p>1.Anyone who held Bitcoin at the time Bitcoin Diamond was created became owners of Bitcoin Diamond which
                is 1BTC:10BCD.
                2.Mining.
                3.Exchange at any other secondary markets.
                4.Contributors in the ecological construction of BCD will receive a certain BCD as a reward.

        <div class="box">
            <h3>What wallet should I keep BTC to get BCD?</h3>
            <p>Any secured Bitcoin wallets can store your BCD before they reach the predetermined height as of block
                495866. If your Bitcoin is stored by a third party, such as an exchanger, then you must inquire them
                about your Bitcoin Diamond. Verified wallets that support BTC and BCD side-by-side will be listed on the
                Bitcoin Diamond home page. We will publish guides for retrieving BCD from the most popular wallets.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h3>If I have BTC on an exchange at the time of the fork, will I get my free BCD?</h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrency exchanges are custodial businesses, which means they control your private keys. When the
                Bitcoin Diamond fork occurs at predetermined height 495866, any exchange that is holding BTC on your
                behalf will also receive the corresponding BCD. While they should credit your account with the equal
                amount of BCD, there is no legal authority that can force them to do so. The Bitcoin Diamond home page
                will display the names and logos of exchanges that have promised to credit their users with BCD at 1:10.
                If your exchange is not shown, please consider transferring your BTC to a supporting exchange or
                withdraw to a personal wallet where you control the private keys.

        <div class="box">
            <h3>How can I sell my Bitcoin Diamond(BCD)?</h3>
            <p>You can sell BCD at any of the exchanges listed on our home page. Or you can trade with a trusted
                broker.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box">
            <h3>Should I buy Bitcoin Diamond?</h3>
            <p>As the developers of the project, we will not predict price or provide any investment advice. We create
                BCD as a free dividend for BTC holders. Anyone who hold Bitcoin at the time when Bitcoin Diamond was
                created became owners of Bitcoin Diamond.
                You can receive the full benefits of this project without any additional risk simply by holding Bitcoin,
                the best form of money the world has ever seen.</p>

        <div class="box">
            <h3>How do I mine Bitcoin Diamond?</h3>
            <p>You can mine BCD using the full node client or you can mine with a pool. Some public mining pools that
                have worked with us are listed on our home page. We invite you to join our facebook, twitter, reddit for
                technical help and advice about mining BCD.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>How does BCD replay attack?</h3>
            <p>The so-called replay attack refer to the fact that if a transaction is valid in BTC, then the bifurcation
                of BTC will also take effect, because most of their algorithms are the same. Means that if someone on
                the BTC launches a deal in the chain and sends the signed deal to another block chain, he will get free
                BTC that shares the same ratio in that block chain. In order to prevent such replay attack, a slight
                change has been made on trading format between BTC and BCD, to prevent the replay trading, BCD will not
                accept BTC deal which truly makes it independent from the BTC.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Why does BCD need to encrypt the transaction amount?</h3>
            <p>In some application scenarios, especially in many business scenarios, or scenarios that are related to
                sensitive data such as income of corporate individuals, the BTC holders do not want to disclose their
                account balances for various reasons. On the one hand, encryption of the transaction amount can protect
                the privacy of personal funds and avoid the coveting from unscrupulous people. On the other hand, some
                funds involves trade secrets of certain financial institutions, encryption can protect their money from
                being exposed, and further ensure the safety of their business activities.
