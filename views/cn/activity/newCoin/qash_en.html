                <h3>Token Overview</h3>
                <p>The Crypto economy has given us a whole new way to build new distributed infrastructure through the use of Crypto Token. People are coming together to fund something they truly want, something they truly believe in. And as Token Holders, they are benefiting from the growth on its utility and value.</p>
                <p>QUOINE, through QUOINE LIQUID TOKEN (QASH), is building a financial utility – a platform that the entire Crypto economy will benefit from and where people can participate in as both users and token holders.</p>
                <p>QASH will be issued by QU0INE Pte. Ltd and may be distributed by itself and/or designated distributors. Please note that QASH does not represent any equity of QUOINE and does not entitle holders to any voting rights, dividends or profit-sharing of any entities of QUOINE. QASH is a Crypto Token that can be used as the fuel that powers services provided by the LIQUID
                    Platform and QUOINE’s existing platforms (QUOINEX and ORYPTOS).</p>
                <h4>QASH has two main functions:</h4>
                <p>1. As Crypto Token users to pay for services on all of our platforms.</p>
                <p>2. As a tradable Crypto Token on the open market.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, QASH will open up to all financial and any other industries. QUOINE will not limit the usage of QASH for business entities that would like to use QASH for their business. Therefore, any companies or organizations andindividuals may be able to utilize QASH as a Crypto Token in the same manner as Bitcoin, Ethereum’s ETH and Rpple’s XRP. </p>
                <p>As the demand for the LIQUID Platform grows, the utility of QASH will increase and will allow QASH holders to use its value to “pay for” all services and functions QUOINE and its partners will provide.</p>
