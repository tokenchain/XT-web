                <h3 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;">Outline</h3>
                <p style="color: #888;">In order to increase your available funds for trading and provide a support for short selling, EXX enables a new leverage rule with the core content of "only accounting the current margin account and risks of the limited liability that the account cannot be liquidated". In order to guarantee the security of the transaction, EXX will be cautious to open the margin markets with depth and set a limit of  maximum leverage times. EXX also will do some price protection measures, however, this cannot 100% protect your positions, please carefully choose the margin times.
                </p>
            </div>


<div class="box">
            <h3> Margin</h3>
            <p>When you trade in a specific market, you can enable Margin Trading by adding a sub-account and choose the leverage time. The system will display the available funds of the leverage times you selected ( if your borrow amount is larger than available amount of the system, you are able to borrow not larger than the system borrowing amount, which will be changed if other users use the amount ). If you enable the Margin trading, the system will borrow the funds according to the leverage times you set. When you place orders, it will priority use your funds and thereafter use the borrowing funds to place orders.</p>
</div>
            <div class="box">
            <h3>Restrictions of Enable Margin Trading</h3>
            <p>Due to the multi-currency, many currencies lack of depth or do not run stably and other reasons, they cannot participate in leverage. EXX adopts the independent sub-account model to support margin trading, which means to start leverage you need to have at least one sub-account that one account only allows to trade one market. You can go to the main account and other sub-accounts to trade other markets. In the margin account, the related currencies are not allowed to transfer-out, only to transfer-in. The other currencies do not participate accounting of liquidation risk and liquidation even if the currencies are transferred in. If the system supports the stable currency such as USDT, it will notify and possibly modify the liquidation calculation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
            <h3>Fees and Repayment</h3>
            <p>1. Leverage is essentially a kind of borrowing. The system serves as a middleman to control risks and profits. Therefore, when the leverage is used and a real loan is generated, a daily borrowing interest will result in a certain borrowing expense, which will be included in the risk assessment of liquidation, But only in the repayment or closing, will be a one-time charge, the principal of interest generated, only after the use of their own funds, and the use of leveraged funds part of the funds will arise, open if you do not use Leverage part of the funds, then does not generate any interest. Without real lending, even if the lever is opened, there will be no risk of liquidation.</p>
            <p>2. All loans that have been generated, unless you manually repay, or when the position is closed, will really repay and stop producing profits.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
            <h3>Leverage Times</h3>
            <p>For protection purposes, the market in principle will not provide more than 5 leverage times, the multiple refers to the actual can borrow multiple, the specific open user can freely choose the magnification, the choice of magnification will be used to limit the user's actual use loan funds will not exceed the rate, does not mean that you must, or have used the rate of funds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">

            <h3>Sources of Funds</h3>
            <p>The lending funds are both from merchants, in the early stage, EXX will introduce more merchants for users.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
            <h3>Liquidation</h3>
                <h4>1. Calculation of Liquidation</h4>
                <p>Different markets may set different leverage ratios, different levels of liquidation risk and different liquidation levels, and have a look about the specific information in the leverage market, Exx takes the actual situation of the percentage of liquidation security, different from the simple principle of the proportion of simple funds, simple statements, it is related to the liquidation risks and the comprehensive calculation of the closing price of your assets, not a simple calculation of the percentage of funds, which is more conducive to the actual risk monitoring, for example, you have both the sale of funds, even through the operation of the two sides all borrowed funds, but this time, the proportion of repayment of funds is very large, at this time in time both you have borrowed, the price may be far from the current price of the open position, this time even if you are under the lever 5, you will still be safe State, the only thing you need to be aware of is the liquidation price, which is almost constant when you do not operate it again, only slightly changed daily unsettled interest.</p>
                 <div style="padding-left: 30px; border-left: 3px solid rgba(0,0,0,.05);">
                <h5>a. Closing Price</h5>
                <p>The calculation of zero personal assets when one has incurred a loan is as follows:</p>
                     <p> Amount of Sellers = Available Freezing of the Sellers Currency - Loans of the Sellers - Unsettled Interest of the Sellers.</p>
                <p>Amount of buyers = buyer's currency available plus freezing - buyer's money borrowed - buyer's currency outstanding interest.</p>
                <p>The price at which the asset is zero = - the amount of sellers / the amount of buyers.</p>
                <p>Closing positions are calculated as "Floating up or Floating down" ("1-Closing ratio") "with a" zero asset value " e.g:</p>
                <p>Risk Ratio: 81% Reminder Ratio: 80% Closing Ratio: 90% Closing Price: 100eth Risk: High</p>
                <p>Means that this position is very dangerous, has triggered a liquidation reminder (reminded every 6 hours), up to 90% of the time to liquidate, but the liquidation price will be in the state of assets to 0 to liquidate.</p>
                <p>If the up is the direction of liquidation, your risk factor will be the lowest if the price is 0, if the downside is the liquidation direction, when the current price is equal to or greater than twice the liquidation price, the risk coefficient is 0, and less then variety.</p>
                <p>A clear chart is given in the Expert Advisor area. The current price, which is close to the price you close, is the single most important indicator that you need to always be aware of.</p>
                <h5>b. Settlement of Interest</h5>
                <p>In the case of borrowing a time point, a natural day is calculated as a natural day, and interest on unsettled interest is calculated on the same day. Borrowing on the same day will generate one unpaid interest at a time, and may be paid separately when the liquidation or settlement is completed.</p>
                 </div>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">2. When liquidating, the system will freeze open the market corresponding to the liquidation of the entire balance of two currencies, notes the details of the funds "close the position with the price of xxx", the system will take over the liquidation process, and the liquidation of the end After the liquidation of funds from frozen to deducted, the extra funds will thaw, and restore the current market is not open to leverage.</p>
                <p>3. Not completely closed the position, the system will continue to lock, and have all the rights to deal with the frozen funds;</p>
                <p>4. Fully handle the positions, the system automatically put the market is not open lever state, you can open the lever again.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="box">
            <h3>Legal Risks and Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>1. Due to the difference of global time zone and operators, EXX system will send a system internal information before the possible liquidation (the general risk coefficient reaches 80%), and users can choose to customize whether to use SMS or email reminder. However, except the system Information can be guaranteed accurate delivery, the other information may be delayed due to reasons such as undeliverable, EXX does not assume any financial compensation for such issues, please be used to maintain sustained attention to the market to avoid losses.</p>
            <p>2. Leverage is essentially a kind of mortgage lending behavior, implemented by the EXX internal guarantee a contract, for the sake of simplifying the system and the safety of liquidation and other considerations, the lender and the borrowers to complete the system buffer separately, all involved in leverage as well as those who generate substantial borrowing, in the belief that the legal utility of borrowing and the above rights of EXX are clear and accepted.</p>
            <p>3. Enable margin trading is to deem that you have agreed to all the above terms and acknowledged the explanation of the contents as well as investment risks.</p>
